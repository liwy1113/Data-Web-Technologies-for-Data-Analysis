For example, there's a [Campus News](https://theaggie.org/campus/) list, [Arts & Culture](https://theaggie.org/arts/) list, and [Sports](https://theaggie.org/sports/) list. Notice that each list has multiple pages, with a maximum of 15 articles per page.\n",

    "* Have a parameter `url` for the URL of the article list.\n",

    "    'text': u'Davis residents create financial model to make city\\'s financial state more transparent To increase transparency between the city\\'s financial situation and the community, three residents created a model called Project Toto which aims to improve how the city communicates its finances in an easily accessible design. Jeff Miller and Matt Williams, who are members of Davis\\' Finance and Budget Commission, joined together with Davis entrepreneur Bob Fung to create the model plan to bring the project to the Finance and Budget Commission in February, according to Kelly Stachowicz, assistant city manager. \"City staff appreciate the efforts that have gone into this, and the interest in trying to look at the city\\'s potential financial position over the long term,\" Stachowicz said in an email interview. \"We all have a shared goal to plan for a sound fiscal future with few surprises. We believe the Project Toto effort will mesh well with our other efforts as we build the budget for the next fiscal year and beyond.\" Project Toto complements the city\\'s effort to amplify the transparency of city decisions to community members. The aim is to increase the understanding about the city\\'s financial situation and make the information more accessible and easier to understand. The project is mostly a tool for public education, but can also make predictions about potential decisions regarding the city\\'s financial future. Once completed, the program will allow residents to manipulate variables to see their eventual consequences, such as tax increases or extensions and proposed developments \"This really isn\\'t a budget, it is a forecast to see the intervention of these decisions,\" Williams said in an interview with The Davis Enterprise. \"What happens if we extend the sales tax? What does it do given the other numbers that are in?\" Project Toto enables users, whether it be a curious Davis resident, a concerned community member or a city leader, with the ability to project city finances with differing variables. The online program consists of the 400-page city budget for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the previous budget, staff reports and consultant analyses. All of the documents are cited and accessible to the public within Project Toto. \"It\\'s a model that very easily lends itself to visual representation,\" Mayor Robb Davis said. \"You can see the impacts of decisions the council makes on the fiscal health of the city.\" Complementary to this program, there is also a more advanced version of the model with more in-depth analyses of the city\\'s finances. However, for an easy-to-understand, simplistic overview, Project Toto should be enough to help residents comprehend Davis finances. There is still more to do on the project, but its creators are hard at work trying to finalize it before the 2017-2018 fiscal year budget. \"It\\'s something I have been very much supportive of,\" Davis said. \"Transparency is not just something that I have been supportive of but something we have stated as a city council objective [ ] this fits very well with our attempt to inform the public of our challenges with our fiscal situation.\" ',\n",

       " 'text': u'Faculty, students recount personal tales of immigration; highlight value of diversityUC Davis students, faculty and members of the Davis community gathered on the Quad on Feb. 9 to display their solidarity with those directly affected by President Donald Trump\\'s immigration ban.In light of the recent executive order, universities across the country have organized similar rallies with the uniting objective of \"Academics United \\u2014 No Visa and Immigration Ban.\" Nazanin Akrami and Ellie White \\u2014 both graduate students at UC Davis in cooperation with SEDAD, the Iranian graduate student association \\u2014 were the organizers of this peaceful rally.The event was approximately an hour long, during which participants were prepared with rain ponchos, umbrellas and signs that displayed slogans such as \"Love not hate makes the nation great\" and \"No ban, No wall, No Trump, No fear.\" It received publicity on multiple news platforms, including Fox 40 and CBS Sacramento.Akrami said that her goal for the event was \"to start a conversation about diversity in order to feel more connected and help people going through these issues.\"The rally showcased many speakers ranging from graduate students, to faculty members, to Mayor Robb Davis, whose speech was titled \"My Home Towns Are Home to the World.\"In his speech the mayor stressed the importance of \"proclaiming ourselves a sanctuary city\" and \\xa0\"welcoming people from all over the world.\"\"They have an order that capriciously excludes people from seven nations at the stroke of a pen, including the victims of wars that have grown in the soil where our nation soiled the seeds of societal destruction in the name of freedom,\" Davis said. \"This affects all of us because it fundamentally puts into question what feels real and natural and beautiful to us. It offends our cultural values.\"Dr. Banafsheh Sadeghi, an assistant professor at the UC Davis School of Medicine, delivered an emotionally-charged speech about her personal experience with the executive order.Sadeghi discussed the fear of entering the unknown as a result of immigration, in addition to the psychological and emotional tolls of making sacrifices for \"following a path that leads to a better world.\"Furthermore, she expressed the grief she felt when she was forced to choose between staying with her children in America or visiting her mother in her home country of Iran the week the executive order was put into effect. She went on to discuss how crucial it is to maintain \"love and compassion\" in such politically turbulent and tense times.Additionally, Koen Van Rompay, a recipient of the Chancellor\\'s Achievement Award for Diversity and Community, and Wesley Young, director of services for international students and scholars, both delivered talks on the priceless value of international ties.Akrami and graduate students Hossein Karimi and Abdolhossein Edalati also shared stories of both triumph and struggle as a result of immigration and the consequences of the ban.White read a statement on behalf of physics professor, Mohammad H. Hamidian, who was unable to be present at the rally.In his statement Hamidian recounted the story of his immigration to Canada as a war refugee during his childhood and later to the U.S. as a student. His statement expressed his concerns for the \"fading opportunities of future immigrant professors, artists, musicians, engineers and teachers\" and how they may not have the chance to \"be safe and reach their potential in a society with so many opportunities.\" On a lighter note, he concluded with having \"immense hope in the outpouring support and generosity of the people in this country.\"UC Davis Yassi Mostafavi, a second-year political science and English double major, and Ariana Abedifard, a second-year environmental policy analysis and planning major, both felt closely connected with the speeches given at the rally.\"As an Iranian, it\\'s heartwarming to see that people are coming out to support those affected by this terrible executive order, these are not the principles this country was founded on,\" Mostafavi said.Abedifard said Sadeghi\\'s speech resonated with her in the sense that \"you have two homes, and it is hard to decide between the two and pick an identity, and things like [the immigration ban] make it even harder.\"',\n",
